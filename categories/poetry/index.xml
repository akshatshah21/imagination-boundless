Echoing melodies of cheers and laughter,<br>
Pauses to listen to the voice<br>
That had once mattered a lot</p>
<br>
<p>Kin sings a ballad to come back home,<br>
Kith beckons it to new ventures ahead,<br>
Dreams play the tune of a terrific tomorrow<br>
While today lifts the needle off that gramophone</p>
<br>
<p>Chirping birds and rustling leaves,<br>
The hum of soothing serenity,<br>
Suddenly the tempo starts climbing<br>
Bringing on the woes of worry, vexatious</p>
<br>
<p>Come chaos, deathcore bellows,<br>
Anger raging, blood roaring,<br>
It yells, it screams, it wails<br>
Until there’s only sombre melancholy chords</p>
<br>
<p>With deafening silence, with maddening cacophonies,<br>
With tears of joy and despair,<br>
Sometimes the tool for magnificence<br>
Sometimes the worst intents of all</p>
<br>
<p>It awes me, it scares me,<br>
How can something<br>
Be so incredibly, polymorphically potent?<br>
The sound of my mind</p>

Trudging on, soon to be dead<br>
Sun scorches on, unaffected<br>
She is burned, and parched.</p>
<br>
<p>But then she sees you,<br>
The green of an oasis<br>
With promises of water<br>
And fruit, rejuvenating<br>
She dives in and swims<br>
And cries, beatific at this reprieve</p>
<hr>
<p>In the night, he is cold<br>
Frigid and chilled to the bone<br>
Teeth chattering, feet going numb<br>
The silent winds roar on, relentless</p>
<br>
<p>But then he hears you,<br>
The crackle of a fire<br>
With promises of warmth<br>
And life, soothing and stroking<br>
Him like a home’s hearth<br>
He sighs, thanking the fire that keeps him going</p>
<hr>
<p>In the barren, it grows scared<br>
Of the uncertainty that is tomorrow<br>
Will it get water, get sunshine?<br>
Or is the seedling’s existence meaningless?</p>
<br>
<p>But then it feels you,<br>
The swell of confidence,<br>
With promises of a bloom<br>
And so grows the seedling<br>
Bravely, leaves and a bud<br>
Which opens up to look at the sky, radiant</p>
<hr>
<p>But now she can’t breathe, she’s drowning<br>
In the sand<br>
And he realizes that the cold was bearable<br>
The fire is simply burning him up now<br>
And the flower is severed away,<br>
Smelled once and thrown out of the way</p>
<br>
<p>Are you a mirage, an illusion?<br>
Or a lure away from despair into something worse?<br>
Or a promise that goes unfulfilled?</p>
<br>
<p>There lies her body, floating in the sand<br>
There lie his ashes, frosting in the cold<br>
There lies the bright rose, now dried up, morose<br>
What are you, hope?</p>
