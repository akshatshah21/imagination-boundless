# Light

It's dark. The usual. Normal.  
And then I hear a hum  
Curious, I go toward it  
Wary like that cat  

<br>

It's you - smiling softly  
Confident and warm and enthusiastic  
Sadistic as ever  

<br>

Presenting dreams of happiness, delusional.  
In exchange for all that's real  
The acceptance of the good and the bad.  
And I scream, shaking and bawling and mad.  

<br>

And like Bane's punishment  
The pit isn't the prison  
It's you, the light at the top.  
And if I did rise to make the climb  
I'd fall right back in  
Back where I can see you  
Back where I belong  
In the darkness  
Just more broken than before  

<br>

One glance at you, hope  
Is all it takes to fill my days with despair  
I let out a final howl  
And lash my fists out at you  
Now they're bloodied  
With protruding pieces of glass  
From the mirror that was you  

<br>

It's dark again. Quiet. Normal.  
Until I hear a hum again.  

<br>

*Look in the mirror. Tell me what you see.*
