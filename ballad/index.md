# Ballad


It skips down the lane of past  
Echoing melodies of cheers and laughter,  
Pauses to listen to the voice  
That had once mattered a lot

<br>

Kin sings a ballad to come back home,  
Kith beckons it to new ventures ahead,  
Dreams play the tune of a terrific tomorrow  
While today lifts the needle off that gramophone

<br>

Chirping birds and rustling leaves,  
The hum of soothing serenity,  
Suddenly the tempo starts climbing  
Bringing on the woes of worry, vexatious

<br>

Come chaos, deathcore bellows,  
Anger raging, blood roaring,  
It yells, it screams, it wails  
Until thereâ€™s only sombre melancholy chords

<br>

With deafening silence, with maddening cacophonies,  
With tears of joy and despair,  
Sometimes the tool for magnificence  
Sometimes the worst intents of all

<br>

It awes me, it scares me,  
How can something  
Be so incredibly, polymorphically potent?  
The sound of my mind
