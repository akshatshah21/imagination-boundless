# What Are You



In the desert, she is stranded  
Trudging on, soon to be dead  
Sun scorches on, unaffected  
She is burned, and parched.

<br>

But then she sees you,  
The green of an oasis  
With promises of water  
And fruit, rejuvenating  
She dives in and swims  
And cries, beatific at this reprieve

<hr>

In the night, he is cold  
Frigid and chilled to the bone  
Teeth chattering, feet going numb  
The silent winds roar on, relentless

<br>

But then he hears you,  
The crackle of a fire  
With promises of warmth  
And life, soothing and stroking  
Him like a home’s hearth  
He sighs, thanking the fire that keeps him going

<hr>

In the barren, it grows scared  
Of the uncertainty that is tomorrow  
Will it get water, get sunshine?  
Or is the seedling’s existence meaningless?  

<br>

But then it feels you,  
The swell of confidence,  
With promises of a bloom  
And so grows the seedling  
Bravely, leaves and a bud  
Which opens up to look at the sky, radiant

<hr>

But now she can’t breathe, she’s drowning  
In the sand  
And he realizes that the cold was bearable  
The fire is simply burning him up now  
And the flower is severed away,  
Smelled once and thrown out of the way

<br>

Are you a mirage, an illusion?  
Or a lure away from despair into something worse?  
Or a promise that goes unfulfilled?

<br>

There lies her body, floating in the sand  
There lie his ashes, frosting in the cold  
There lies the bright rose, now dried up, morose  
What are you, hope?
