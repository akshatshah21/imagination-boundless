[{"categories":["poetry"],"content":"It’s dark. The usual. Normal. And then I hear a hum Curious, I go toward it Wary like that cat It’s you - smiling softly Confident and warm and enthusiastic Sadistic as ever Presenting dreams of happiness, delusional. In exchange for all that’s real The acceptance of the good and the bad. And I scream, shaking and bawling and mad. And like Bane’s punishment The pit isn’t the prison It’s you, the light at the top. And if I did rise to make the climb I’d fall right back in Back where I can see you Back where I belong In the darkness Just more broken than before One glance at you, hope Is all it takes to fill my days with despair I let out a final howl And lash my fists out at you Now they’re bloodied With protruding pieces of glass From the mirror that was you It’s dark again. Quiet. Normal. Until I hear a hum again. Look in the mirror. Tell me what you see.

But then she sees you, The green of an oasis With promises of water And fruit, rejuvenating She dives in and swims And cries, beatific at this reprieve In the night, he is cold Frigid and chilled to the bone Teeth chattering, feet going numb The silent winds roar on, relentless But then he hears you, The crackle of a fire With promises of warmth And life, soothing and stroking Him like a home’s hearth He sighs, thanking the fire that keeps him going In the barren, it grows scared Of the uncertainty that is tomorrow Will it get water, get sunshine? Or is the seedling’s existence meaningless? But then it feels you, The swell of confidence, With promises of a bloom And so grows the seedling Bravely, leaves and a bud Which opens up to look at the sky, radiant But now she can’t breathe, she’s drowning In the sand And he realizes that the cold was bearable The fire is simply burning him up now And the flower is severed away, Smelled once and thrown out of the way Are you a mirage, an illusion? Or a lure away from despair into something worse? Or a promise that goes unfulfilled? There lies her body, floating in the sand There lie his ashes, frosting in the cold There lies the bright rose, now dried up, morose What are you, hope?
