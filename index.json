[{"categories":["poetry"],"content":"It skips down the lane of past Echoing melodies of cheers and laughter, Pauses to listen to the voice That had once mattered a lot Kin sings a ballad to come back home, Kith beckons it to new ventures ahead, Dreams play the tune of a terrific tomorrow While today lifts the needle off that gramophone Chirping birds and rustling leaves, The hum of soothing serenity, Suddenly the tempo starts climbing Bringing on the woes of worry, vexatious Come chaos, deathcore bellows, Anger raging, blood roaring, It yells, it screams, it wails Until there’s only sombre melancholy chords With deafening silence, with maddening cacophonies, With tears of joy and despair, Sometimes the tool for magnificence Sometimes the worst intents of all It awes me, it scares me, How can something Be so incredibly, polymorphically potent?

But then she sees you, The green of an oasis With promises of water And fruit, rejuvenating She dives in and swims And cries, beatific at this reprieve In the night, he is cold Frigid and chilled to the bone Teeth chattering, feet going numb The silent winds roar on, relentless But then he hears you, The crackle of a fire With promises of warmth And life, soothing and stroking Him like a home’s hearth He sighs, thanking the fire that keeps him going In the barren, it grows scared Of the uncertainty that is tomorrow Will it get water, get sunshine? Or is the seedling’s existence meaningless? But then it feels you, The swell of confidence, With promises of a bloom And so grows the seedling Bravely, leaves and a bud Which opens up to look at the sky, radiant But now she can’t breathe, she’s drowning In the sand And he realizes that the cold was bearable The fire is simply burning him up now And the flower is severed away, Smelled once and thrown out of the way Are you a mirage, an illusion? Or a lure away from despair into something worse? Or a promise that goes unfulfilled? There lies her body, floating in the sand There lie his ashes, frosting in the cold There lies the bright rose, now dried up, morose What are you, hope?
